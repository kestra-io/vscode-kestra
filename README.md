# Kestra extension for VSCode

## Features
- Flow autocompletion & validation on .yaml / .yml files by downloading the JSON schema from your Kestra's instance or Kestra's API server as a fallback (meaning you will see all plugins except custom ones, even those which are not yet installed on your instance)

## Requirements
- [Redhat's YAML extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-yaml)

## Usage 
After installing the extension, you will get a new command called "Download Kestra schema" which will prompt you for a Kestra's instance URL and eventually credentials if your instance is secured. If you have a JWT based authentication (EE), please copy your token from the "Copy JWT token" button available in the same menu as the Logout button.
By default it will use the Kestra's API server which has the above-described issues.
Once you proceed, you will get a notification asking for a window reload, please save all your changes then proceed.
You now have autocompletion and validation for every .yaml / .yml files. If you have multiple yaml autocompletion helpers, please select the Kestra's one
